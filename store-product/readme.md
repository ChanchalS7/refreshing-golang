We are building a software for a store that sells three products: `apples, bananas,` and `oranges`. We need to write a function that takes the name of a product and its price as arguments and returns the price of the product with a discount applied. The discount should be `10%` for `apples` and `20%` for `bananas`. `Oranges `do not have a discount.
