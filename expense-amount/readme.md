We are building a program that helps users track their expenses. We need to create a struct called `Expense` to store information about an individual `expense`, including the name of the `expense`, the `amount`, and the `date`.

We need to create a method called `Total` that calculates the `total` amount spent on expenses.

Also, we need to create a method called `getName` on `Expense` struct that returns the name of the` Expense`.
